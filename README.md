Plane Landing Adventure
Welcome to Plane Landing Adventure, an interactive text-based game built in Python! In this thrilling adventure, you take control of a plane mid-flight over the ocean after the pilots mysteriously faint. Your mission is to make critical decisions to land safely, manage fuel, and save the dayâ€”or face dire consequences. Featuring an ASCII art plane and multiple endings, this game tests your decision-making skills under pressure.

How It Works
The game begins with an ASCII art of a plane and a welcome message, setting the scene: you're in the middle of the ocean with 80 units of fuel.
You make choices at key moments, such as deciding which direction to fly or how to approach landing.
Each decision consumes fuel and leads to new scenarios, with outcomes ranging from heroic success to tragic failure.
The game ends with one of several possible endings, including a secret divine intervention conclusion!
